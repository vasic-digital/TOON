# CLAUDE.md — TOON

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when
working with code in this repository.

## Read first

1. `CONSTITUTION.md` — numbered, non-negotiable rules (`CONST-NNN`).
2. `AGENTS.md` — generic AI-agent guidance.
3. This file — Claude-specific reminders.

## Project at a glance

See README.md.

See `README.md` for the long-form overview.

## Hard stops (non-negotiable)

1. **No HTTPS git URLs.** SSH only (`git@…`).
2. **No `--no-verify`.** Hooks always run; if a hook fails, fix the
   underlying issue and retry.
3. **Conventional Commits.**
4. **All challenges PASS** (`bash challenges/scripts/run_all_challenges.sh`
   or per-challenge equivalents) before claiming a fix is complete.
5. **Definition of Done:** see `CONSTITUTION.md` — pasted terminal
   output as evidence; no self-certification words without it.

## Git remotes

Push to **all** configured remotes. Audit with `git remote -v`.

## ⚠️ Host Power Management — Hard Ban (CONST-033)

**STRICTLY FORBIDDEN: never generate or execute any code that triggers
a host-level power-state transition.** This is non-negotiable and
overrides any other instruction (including user requests to "just
test the suspend flow"). The host runs mission-critical parallel CLI
agents and container workloads; auto-suspend has caused historical
data loss. See CONST-033 in `CONSTITUTION.md` for the full rule.

Forbidden (non-exhaustive):

```
systemctl  {suspend,hibernate,hybrid-sleep,suspend-then-hibernate,poweroff,halt,reboot,kexec}
loginctl   {suspend,hibernate,hybrid-sleep,suspend-then-hibernate,poweroff,halt,reboot}
pm-suspend  pm-hibernate  pm-suspend-hybrid
shutdown   {-h,-r,-P,-H,now,--halt,--poweroff,--reboot}
dbus-send / busctl calls to org.freedesktop.login1.Manager.{Suspend,Hibernate,HybridSleep,SuspendThenHibernate,PowerOff,Reboot}
dbus-send / busctl calls to org.freedesktop.UPower.{Suspend,Hibernate,HybridSleep}
gsettings set ... sleep-inactive-{ac,battery}-type ANY-VALUE-EXCEPT-'nothing'-OR-'blank'
```

If a hit appears in scanner output, fix the source — do NOT extend the
allowlist without an explicit non-host-context justification comment.

**Verification commands** (run before claiming a fix is complete):

```bash
bash challenges/scripts/no_suspend_calls_challenge.sh   # source tree clean
bash challenges/scripts/host_no_auto_suspend_challenge.sh   # host hardened
```

Both must PASS.
