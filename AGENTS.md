# AGENTS.md — TOON

> **Audience:** AI coding agents (Codex, Cursor, OpenCode, Crush, etc.)
> working in this repository. For Claude Code specifically, see also
> `CLAUDE.md`.

## Project at a glance

See README.md.

See `README.md` for the long-form overview.

## How to work in this repo

1. Read `CONSTITUTION.md` first — its numbered rules (`CONST-NNN`) are
   non-negotiable.
2. Use SSH URLs for git (`git@…`). HTTPS is prohibited.
3. Conventional Commits (`feat:`, `fix:`, `chore:`, …).
4. Run `challenges/scripts/run_all_challenges.sh` before claiming a
   fix is complete (or the per-challenge equivalents listed in
   `README.md`).
5. Don't bypass git hooks (`--no-verify`). If a hook fails, fix the
   underlying issue and retry.

## Git remotes

Push to **all** configured remotes. Audit with `git remote -v`.

## Host Power Management — Hard Ban (CONST-033)

**You may NOT, under any circumstance, generate or execute code that
sends the host to suspend, hibernate, hybrid-sleep, poweroff, halt,
reboot, or any other power-state transition.** This rule applies to:

- Every shell command you run via the Bash tool.
- Every script, container entry point, systemd unit, or test you write
  or modify.
- Every CLI suggestion, snippet, or example you emit.

**Forbidden invocations** (non-exhaustive — see CONST-033 in
`CONSTITUTION.md` for the full list):

- `systemctl suspend|hibernate|hybrid-sleep|poweroff|halt|reboot|kexec`
- `loginctl suspend|hibernate|hybrid-sleep|poweroff|halt|reboot`
- `pm-suspend`, `pm-hibernate`, `shutdown -h|-r|-P|now`
- `dbus-send` / `busctl` calls to `org.freedesktop.login1.Manager.Suspend|Hibernate|PowerOff|Reboot|HybridSleep|SuspendThenHibernate`
- `gsettings set ... sleep-inactive-{ac,battery}-type` to anything but `'nothing'` or `'blank'`

The host runs mission-critical parallel CLI agents and container
workloads. Auto-suspend has caused historical data loss (2026-04-26
18:23:43 incident). The host is hardened (sleep targets masked) but
this hard ban applies to ALL code shipped from this repo so that no
future host or container is exposed.

**Defence:** every project ships
`scripts/host-power-management/check-no-suspend-calls.sh` (static
scanner) and
`challenges/scripts/no_suspend_calls_challenge.sh` (challenge wrapper).
Both MUST be wired into the project's CI / `run_all_challenges.sh`.

**Full background:** `docs/HOST_POWER_MANAGEMENT.md` and `CONSTITUTION.md` (CONST-033).

## Article XI §11.9 — Anti-Bluff Forensic Anchor (cascaded from parent CONSTITUTION.md)

> Verbatim user mandate (2026-04-29, reasserted multiple times across 2026-05): *"We had been in position that all tests do execute with success and all Challenges as well, but in reality the most of the features does not work and can't be used! This MUST NOT be the case and execution of tests and Challenges MUST guarantee the quality, the completion and full usability by end users of the product!"*

Operative rule: **The bar for shipping is not "tests pass" but "users can use the feature."** Every PASS in this codebase MUST carry positive runtime evidence captured during execution. Metadata-only / configuration-only / absence-of-error / grep-based PASS without runtime evidence are critical defects regardless of how green the summary line looks. No false-success results are tolerable.

This anchor MUST remain in this submodule's CONSTITUTION.md, CLAUDE.md, and AGENTS.md alongside CONST-047 — see the parent repository's `CONSTITUTION.md` for the full text.
